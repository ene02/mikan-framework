# üçä Mikan.Toolkit

**Mikan Toolkit** is a personal library i'm developing to simplify working with the BASS library and SDL, im not using the raw libraries, but bindings, specifically ManagedBass and SDL2-CS, so i guess you could say this is a binding of a binding, dont know if i will make ose of these but i just wanted to program something.
