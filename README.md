# Mikan Toolkit

**Mikan Toolkit** is a personal library I'm developing to simplify working with **BASS**, **SDL**, and **Veldrid** for my own projects. It’s a toolkit designed for specific tasks, and is not a full-featured framework or library.

## What It Is

- A toolkit for my personal use, focused on the parts of **BASS**, **SDL**, and **Veldrid** that I need.
- Not a complete binding of all features—only the parts I’ve found useful so far.
- Still a work in progress (WIP), so features may be added or changed over time.

## Libraries Used

- **BASS**: Audio processing.
- **SDL**: Windowing and input.
- **Veldrid**: Rendering.

## Cross-Platform & Mobile Support

- Technically cross-platform, but not fully tested across all platforms.
- Mobile support is possible but untested.

## Why It Exists

Mikan was created to simplify my development workflow with these libraries. It’s not a universal solution, just something that works for what I need at the moment.
